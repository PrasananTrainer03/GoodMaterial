Angular have flexibility to call external data into Angular framework, that 
can be achieved by using HttpServices. 

HttpServices allows you to call external services, as the data to be binded to angular
components.

To deal with services, after creating project, we need 

npm install @angular/http@latest 

npm install rxjs-compat --save

To call the services, we need the help of React JS Observables concept. 

Once you send any request to exteranl services, it emits 2 promise values known as 

Resolve and Reject 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Resolve means if the service consumed successfully,

Reject means 

if service throws an error. 

This kind of data we need to capture then we need the help of Observables. 

Observables allows you to capture more than one result at a time, they can be synchronized.

Steps involved in calling the service 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

the above service, we need to call in angular, then 

create an angular project as 

ng new servicedemo

after that enter into that folder as

cd servicedemo

now install the below 

npm install rxjs-compat --save

Then in app.module.ts file please import 

HttpClientModule

First you need to create a class, and give same fields with case that the service fields
contains

ng g class User
export class User {

    public id : number;
    public name : string;
    public username : string;
    public email : string;
    public phone : string;
    public website : string;
    constructor() {

    }
}


Then you need to create service, 

to create the service give the command as 

ng g service service_name 

ng g service User
