Database : 

A database is set of interrelated files, stored with min. redundancy to serve many users work concurrently. 

DBMS : The software that which allows you to perform transactions on data like adding new data, modifying already existing data and removing unwanted data known as DBMS. 

Objectives : 
____________


	(i) Provides an efficient and convinient env, that which allows you store data in and retrieve data

	(ii) Granting access on data to users based on their credentials


Drawbacks : 
____________

	(i) Data Redundancy

	(ii) Risk to Data Integrity

       (iii) Data Isolation

	(iv) Difficult Access to Data

	 (v) Unsatisfactory Security Measures 



ER stands for Entity Relationship model. 

Entity is a thing, that which can be easily identified. 

A person we call as an entity, and a place we call as an entity. 

Entities can be represented using Rectangle. 

Relationship is an association among various entities. 

There are various types of relationships as 

	(i) One to One : One field in the first entity, exactly matches with only one field in the second
				entity. 

	(ii) One to Many : One field in the first entity, exactly matches with one field in the second entity 				known as One to Manay relationship

	(iii) Many to Many 


Relational system contains various keys as 

Employ(Empno,Ename,job,sal,Gender,AadharNo,Deptno)

1) Candidate Key : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of a table known as candidate key. Empno, AadharNo

2) Primary Key : One of the candidate key needs to be chosen as primary key based on priority. (Empno)
Primary key column cannot be null, no duplicates

3) Alternate Key : Any key that which is candidate key, but not primary key known as Alternate Key. (AadharNo)

4) Composite Key : Any key that which uniquely identifies rows of a table made up of more than one attribute 
		known as composite key. 

5) Foreign Key : Primary key in the parent table will be foreign key in the child table. 

Aggregate Functions :
_________________________

sum() : Used to perform sum operation on the given field(s)

Group By : Used to generate summary reports on the field specified. 

Having Clause : used to perform conditions on aggregate field(s)

The difference between where clause and having clause is where clause used to check conditions on 
table field(s), as having clause used to check conditions on aggregate field(s) 

Joins : Joins allows you to retrieve data from more than one table. There are various types of joins as 

	(i) Inner Join : Inner Join Acts as an INTERSECT operator, used to extract only the common records
		from the given table(s)

	In given scenario, Dept table contains DeptNo as primary key, and Emp table contains DeptNo as 
		foreign key. 

	Then how we retrieve data from both table 

Error Code: 1052. Column 'Deptno' in field list is ambiguous


	(ii) Outer Join : There are various types of outer joins as 

		(i) Left Outer Join : It displays all records from left-side table, and matching records from
			the right-side table. If any table corresponding records are not found, then it would
			be replaced with NULL keyword. 

		(ii) Right Outer Join : All records from the right-side table, and matching records from the
		Left-Side table. 

	(iii) Cross Join : Generates cartician product of given table table rows. As, Table A contains n records and Table B contains m records, then the result will be n*m records 

	 (iv) Self Join : If a table joins with itself, known as self join.
