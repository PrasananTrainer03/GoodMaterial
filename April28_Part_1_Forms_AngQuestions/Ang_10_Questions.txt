imports
	Contains system defined modules required to run the program.
providers
	Any external services to be injected to this page

bootStrap

	Which component we have to run as default component.



4) How module file will be decorated

@NgModule

5) How angular project will be executed (Execution Process)

	Once you start the project as (npm start), then first it loads the app.module.ts file 
	
	In that it checks all components, piples, filters, services etc... and then it goes to the bootstrap and in that
	which component defined that component will be loaded. 

	Then it need to load all dependencies (node_modules), as all node_modules are registered in the file 
	package.json file, from that it lists all dependencies and loads all dependencies. 

	After processing all data, browser converts server-script into client-script and sends the data to 
	index.html where we can interpret over code. 






6) How to Create a component, and how to add component to the page

ng g c comp_name  
Then copy the selector tag from ts file and paste in html tags of target page.

7) What the purpose of routing

Navigate from one page to another page.

Navigate w.r.t. HTML ex : <a [routerLink] = "['menu']">Menu</a>
Navigate w.r.t. Ts ex : this._router.navigate(["/menu"]);

8) How to apply routing on the page (explain step by step)

   -> How to redirect to default component :

   -> How to go to error component 

	{path:'**', component:ErrorComponent}

    -> How to make placeHolder for routing 

	<router-outlet> </router-outlet>
9) Give the syntax for component file (selector,tempalateUrl,styleUrls etc...)
@Component({
  selector: 'app-placeorder',
  templateUrl: './htmfilel',
  styleUrls: ['./css']
})
