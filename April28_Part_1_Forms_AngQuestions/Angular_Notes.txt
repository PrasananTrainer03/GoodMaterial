Angular Purely works on the basis of MVVM architecture. 

Model-View/View-Model 

Module : 

When you run any angular application, at first it starts execution from app.module.ts file,

in that we have different sections as 

declarations :

   Contains List of Custom Components

imports : 
	
	Contains list of system defined imports for the given project. 

providers : 

	Contains list of services available in the current project. 

bootStrap 

	Which component we are supposed to run, to be defined in the bootStrap. 

You can identify the module file with decorator 

@NgModule 

Angular is all about component, 

as any business logic you have to write, that must be specified in component only. 


You can create a component 


ng g c component_name

You can idenfify component by using decorator as

@Component 

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

Used to display the component, then please use the selector. 

templateUrl : For that particular component, which is the relevant html file to display data, to be given in templateUrl 

styleUrls : Contains list of css files, which allows you to make look and feel of the given component. 

You can create a class in angular as 

ng generate class class_name
