MongoDb we call as noSql, as it is a light weight database, which performs all crud operations. 

To start with mongodb, first create a folder in d drive as mongopractice

and specify the command as

mongod --dbpath "d:\mongopractice"

As the instance in command prompt to be run continuously, then to start practice with mongoDb use the below command in another command prompt terminal as

mongo

Then you can create any database as 

use db_name

use batch9

To See the current Database then

db

MongoDb contains various sections as

Database : The physicalcontainer for collections, each database gets its own set of files on
the file system, A single MongoDb typically has multiple databases. 

Collection : Collection is a groiup of MongoDb documents, it is the equivalent of an RDBMS table, 
Collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enfore a schema, 
documents within collection can have different fields. 

Document : A document is a set of key-value pairs, documents hav dynamic schema, means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure. 

db.demo.insert({"empno":1,"Name":"Prasanna","Gender":"Male"})

This is the way we need to insert any document. 

demo is collection

To drop any database 

db.dropDatabase()

To Create any Collection, please give the command as 

db.createCollection()

To See list of collections avaialble, then 

show collections

To Insert Data into Collection, then 

db.Employ.insert({"Empno":1,"Name":"Prasanna","Gender":"Male","Dept":"Java","Desig":"Trainer",
"Basic":83234})

db.Employ.insert([
   {"Empno":2,"Name":"Tushar","Gender":"Male","Dept":"Java","Desig":"Developer","Basic":84823},
   {"Empno":3,"Name":"Srinivasa","Gender":"Male","Dept":"Python","Desig":"Developer","Basic":78844},
   {"Empno":4,"Name":"Sujatha","Gender":"Female","Dept":"Sql","Desig":"Manager","Basic":90523},
   {"Empno":5,"Name":"Swathi","Gender":"Female","Dept":"Java","Desig":"Manager","Basic":95423},
   {"Empno":6,"Name":"Sumit","Gender":"Male","Dept":"Java","Desig":"Developer","Basic":84823}
])

To Query the records of particular collection, then 

db.collection_name.find()

db.Employ.find()

To Query and Display the results in formatted way, then 

db.collection_name.find().pretty()
db.Employ.find().pretty()

To Filter Data, then 

db.Employ.find({Dept:'Java'})

db.Employ.find({Gender:'Female'})

db.Employ.find({"Basic":{$gt:90000}}).pretty();

$gt : Greater Than

$lt : Less than

$gte : Greater than or equals to 

$lte : Less than or equals to

$ne: Not Equals to 
$in : Acts as In keyword
$nin : Acts as Not IN Keyword

db.Employ.find({"Name":{$in:["Sujatha","Swathi","Tushar"]}}).pretty()

db.Employ.find({"Name":{$nin:["Sujatha","Swathi","Tushar"]}}).pretty()
