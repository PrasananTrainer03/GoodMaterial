1) What is POM stands for 


Project Object Model

2) Maven is a build tool, that which allows you create a project in easiest way.

It has 2 folders as

main
test

main module contains all the business logic
test module contains all the test cases. 



Maven overcomes the problems of adding jar files to the project. 

Instead of adding jar files to the project, we need to add the dependencies to the 
given project. 

What the dependency contains 

a) 
<dependency>
  <groupid>junit</groupid>
  <artifactid>Junit 4.12</artifactid>
  <version>4.12</version>
<dependency>

b)
<dependency>
  <groupid>junit</groupid>
  <version>4.12</version>
<dependency>

c)
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>Junit4.12</artifactId>
  <version>4.12</version>
</dependency>

d)

<dependency>
  <artifactId>Junit 4.12</artifactId>
  <version>4.12</version>
<dependency>

Maven Architecture : 
_____________________


    Once you run any maven project, first it scans all pom.xml file and first, it checks
the the jar files are available in 

1) Local Repository 

c:\users\user_name\.m2 folder 

If it is not avaiable in local repository, then it goes to central repositry

Still its not available then it goes to 

remote repository

Maven Life Cycle 
_________________

validate : Validates all the information for the project.

Example : you gave version of mysql as 8.0.28 is it valid version or not, if it valid then get the jar file from repository,  (local/central/remote)

compile : Used to compile source code

mvn compile 

test : Used to run the test cases 
mvn test

package : Used to make resource file for the compiled code

mvn package 

then it compiles/test and package the given code.

integration test

Deploys the jar/war files.

verify

install

install the working project in given env.

deploy 

make an executable file for given working env.
