1) How to see the list of images in docker

docker images

2) How to create a docker image

docker build -t java-app .      

3) How to run docker image

docker run image_name

4) How to run docker image interactive mode

docker run -it image_name

5) Docker Properties

FROM: As the base for our image, we'll take the Java-enabled Alpine Linux created in the previous section.
MAINTAINER: The maintainer of the image.
COPY: We let Docker copy our jar file into the image.
ENTRYPOINT: This will be the executable to start when the container is booting. We must define them as JSON-Array because we'll use an ENTRYPOINT in combination with a CMD for some application arguments.

Docker tool is a vital part of the configuration management tool in most of the global companies. Docker tool runs an application with the help of dockerfile with a high level of abstraction and security. Hence, many companies are extensively adopting the tool to achieve high network availability, service continuity, and service provision with high scalability. 

However, global news wire has confirmed that the demand for docker tools in the market will eventually grow from USD 217 million to USD 993 million by 2024. This growth is exponential.

The reason for Docker being so popular is Docker image, Docker container and Dockerfile. However, Docker Image can be created only with the help of Dockerfiles. Moving forward, let us understand docker and dockerfile in detail.

Docker container is a software package that has all the dependencies required to run an application.

Note: A Docker Image is a template of instructions used to create containers

What is a Dockerfile?
Before we discuss what is a Dockerfile, it is important to know what a Docker image is. 

Docker Image:
A Docker Image is a read-only file with a bunch of instructions. When these instructions are executed, it creates a Docker container.

Dockerfile:
Dockerfile is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images.

Mentioned below is the syntax of a Dockerfile:

Syntax

# comments

command argument argument1...

Example

# Print "Get Certified. Get Ahead"

Run echo "Get Certified. Get Ahead"

Now, let's have a look at how to build a Docker image using a dockerfile.

List of Docker Commands for Creating a Dockerfile
Before we create our first Dockerfile, it is important to understand what makes up the file. 

Dockerfile consists of specific commands that guide you on how to build a specific Docker image. 

The specific commands you can use in a dockerfile are:

FROM, PULL, RUN, and CMD

FROM - Creates a layer from the ubuntu:18.04
PULL - Adds files from your Docker repository
RUN - Builds your container
CMD - Specifies what command to run within the container

docker build -t java-app .      

What is the purpose of . here,

to make a docker image for the current project
